### Reconstructed quire layout

For each manuscript, multiple instances of the following group of fields can be filed, each one describing a single quire.

These fields are not part of the [manuscripts table](/schema/manuscripts) but of the [m_quires table](/schema/m_quires).

#### QUIRE NO.
- Modern number assigned to the quire
- DB id: `quireno`

#### QUIRE LAYOUT
- Schematic representation of the quire layout obtained by means of an *ad hoc*-elaborated tool (quireMatrix by J. Bogdani, DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.1453362](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1453362), working demo: [https://paths-erc.github.io/quireMatrix/](https://paths-erc.github.io/quireMatrix/)): a dependency-less software to visualise in the browser the layout of quires, using a highly intuitive notation system. The software is written in vanilla javascript and can be run in every browser. The code is available for download at PAThs' official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/paths-erc/quireMatrix](https://github.com/paths-erc/quireMatrix) and is released with MIT License.
- DB id: `quirelayout`

#### PAPIRUS QUIRE TYPOLOGY
- Papyrus quire typology, according to E.G. Turner, *The Typology of the Early Codex*, Philadelphia 1977.
The fibre direction of the first page is noted (â for horizontal fibres, and â for vertical fibres) and followed by the pattern of composition of the quire, i.e. âlike facing likeâ when a double page shows the same fibre direction or âalternanceâ when the fibre direction alternates in a double page. If the quire is of mixed type, its composition is accurately described in âQuire notesâ (see below).
- DB id: `quirepaptype`

#### PARCHMENT QUIRE TYPOLOGY
- Parchment quire typology, according to E.G. Turner, *The Typology of the Early Codex*, Philadelphia 1977.
The parchment side of the first page is noted (F for flesh side, and H for hair side) and followed by the pattern of composition of the quire, i.e. âlike facing likeâ when a double page shows the same parchment side (and respects the Gregory rule) or âalternanceâ when the parchment side alternates in a double page. If the quire is of mixed type, its composition is accurately described in [Quire notes](#quire-notes).
- DB id: `quirepartype`

#### QUIRE NOTES
- Ancient quire signature. Special characteristics of the structure and composition of the quire, e.g. ââ\|ââ\|ââ\|ââ\|\|ââ\|ââ\|ââ\|ââ or F H\|H F\|F H\|F H\|\|H F\|H F\|F H\|H F, where \| shows the passage from one leaf to the next; \|\| shows the centre of the quire. For papyrus codices, the scheme â-â or â-â indicates a change of fibre direction in the page, i.e. in case of a kollÄsis: e.g. â-â â-â\|â-â â-â.
